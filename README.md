## Implementation
To implement this data structure, I first defined a node class that contains all the attributes and functions related to each node. Then, a Trie Tree class is defined to manage the essential operations such as inserting, deleting, etc. Finally, my implementation was capable of storing and retrieving about 200 words in a reasonable time, less than 2 seconds.
